# Tutorials

In this part of the book we will see some tutorials to learn hands-on several useful features offered by the Duckiematrix.

The demos are collected in [this](https://github.com/duckietown/duckiematrix-examples) GitHub repo.
In order to use them, the first step is to clone the repository to your machine by running:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duckietown/duckiematrix-examples.git
```

Each demo will have to be executed from its specific directory, as instructed.
Have fun, will you choose the blue pill or the red one?
